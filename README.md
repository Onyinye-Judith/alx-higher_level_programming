Higher-level programming refers to the practice of writing computer programs using programming languages that are more abstract and user-friendly, allowing developers to focus on the logic of their applications rather than dealing with low-level details of the computer's architecture. These languages provide a higher level of abstraction from machine code and typically offer built-in functions and structures that simplify complex tasks.
Characteristics of higher-level programming languages include:Abstraction: They provide abstractions that shield developers from low-level details, such as memory management and hardware interactions.Readability: Higher-level languages are designed to be more human-readable, making it easier for programmers to understand and maintain code.Productivity: Developers can achieve more in less time due to the availability of built-in functions, libraries, and frameworks, reducing the need to write code from scratch.Portability: Programs written in higher-level languages are often more portable across different platforms, as the language abstracts away hardware-specific details.Automated Memory Management: Many higher-level languages incorporate automatic memory management, relieving developers from manual memory allocation and deallocation.
Examples of higher-level programming languages include Python, Java, C#, and Ruby. These languages are well-suited for various applications, from web development to scientific computing, due to their ease of use and versatility.
