In Python, exceptions are events that occur during program execution that disrupt the normal flow of the program. The try, except block is used to handle exceptions. When a statement in the try block raises an exception, the corresponding except block is executed.

Python has built-in exception types like ZeroDivisionError, TypeError, etc., but you can also create custom exception classes to handle specific situations in your code.
