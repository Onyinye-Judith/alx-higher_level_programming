Python input/output (I/O) refers to the process of getting data into a Python program and sending data out of it. This includes reading data from sources such as the keyboard, files, or networks, and writing data to outputs such as the screen, files, or networks. Python provides several built-in functions and modules to perform input/output operations efficiently, such as input() for getting user input from the keyboard, open() for reading and writing files, and various modules like sys, os, and io for handling different types of input/output operations.
