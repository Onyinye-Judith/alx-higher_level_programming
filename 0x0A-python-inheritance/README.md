In Python, inheritance is a mechanism that allows a new class, called the derived class or subclass, to inherit attributes and methods from an existing class, known as the base class or superclass. This enables code reuse and the creation of a hierarchy of classes.

a. Base Class (Superclass): The class whose attributes and methods are inherited.

b. Derived Class (Subclass): The class that inherits from another class.

c. Inheriting Attributes and Methods: The derived class can access the attributes and methods of the base class.

d. Overriding: The derived class can provide a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in the base class.

e. Method Resolution Order (MRO): The order in which Python looks for methods in a class hierarchy.
